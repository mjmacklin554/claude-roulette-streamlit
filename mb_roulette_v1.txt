# Project: Roulette Betting System
# File: mb_roulette_v1.txt

## Overview:
Create a command-line Roulette Betting System which displays the results in a Pandas DataFrame. The System consists of 2 Stages. Stage 1 is a Betting Stage and Stage 2 is the Recovery Stage. The System uses 2 Lists of User-Defined Numbers, A1 and A2 as numbers that have been Bet on and a predefined list of Roulette Outcomes. In this Game 1 Chip = $1 and the Starting Bank is $1000. The System consists of many Sequences. Each Sequence ends when a profit is made or the bank is lost. For a Sequence to begin a Set of Rules must be satisfied.

## Betting Logic:

### Betting begins with Stage 1

#### Stage 1: Sequential Betting System - Only ONE bet per outcome

The system places only ONE bet per roulette outcome, following this progression:

1.	**Bet1**: Uses numbers in the A2 list. Bet of 5 Chips. Win = +1 chip profit, Lose = -5 chips
   - If Bet1 WINS: Move to next outcome, start with Bet1 again
   - If Bet1 LOSES: Move to next outcome, try Bet2

2.	**Bet2**: Uses numbers in the A1 list. Bet of 4 chips. Win = +5 chips profit, Lose = -4 chips
   - If Bet2 WINS: Move to next outcome, start with Bet1 again
   - If Bet2 LOSES: Move to next outcome, try Bet3

3.  **Bet3**: Uses numbers in the A1 list. Bet of 8 chips. Win = +10 chips profit, Lose = -8 chips
   - If Bet3 WINS: Move to next outcome, start with Bet1 again
   - If Bet3 LOSES: **Stage 1 ends, proceed to Stage 2**

**Example Flow:**
- Lines 1-5: No bets (waiting for initial A1 win trigger)
- Line 6: First bet with codes (3,4,2), Bet1=5chips on A2, Win
- Line 7: Next bet with codes, Bet1=5chips on A2, Win
- Line 8: Bet with codes, Bet1=5chips on A2, Win (outcome 2 is in A1) → **Triggers A1 Wait Rule**
- Lines 9-11: No bets (waiting for 3 consecutive non-A1 outcomes: 16,22,7)
- Line 12: Resume betting (A1 wait period ended)
- Bet progression: Bet1(5chips,A2) → Bet2(4chips,A1) → Bet3(8chips,A1)
- After any win: Reset to Bet1
- After Bet3 loss: Stage 1 ends

#### Stage 2:

28        7   L   12   75   12        5          -2       .3     
   29       30   L   13   87   12        4          -3       
   30       30   L   13   87   12        8          -5   NaN           




## A1 Wait Rule:

- **Trigger**: After any A1 win (when outcome is in A1 list AND bet wins)
- **Betting**: Betting STOPS during wait period
- **Sequence Codes**: Continue to be calculated and recorded normally
- **Wait Condition**: System waits for 3 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Reset Rule**: Any A1 outcome during wait resets the counter to 0
- **Resume**: Betting resumes on the line AFTER the 3rd consecutive non-A1 outcome
- **Example**: Line 8 A1 win → Lines 9-11 show sequence codes but no bets → Line 12 resume betting

## Four Corner Loss Rule:

- **Trigger**: After 4 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Action Taken**: Calculate the new Sequence Code but don't record it on the next line
- **Wait Condition**: System waits for A1 outcome 
- **Resume**: Current Sequence Code is now recorded the line AFTER
- **Example**: Line 23: outcomes [1,33,10,15] ->  new code 9 45 10 but NOT recorded on 
    the NEXT line. Line24: A1 win -> current sequence code now recorded the line AFTER







## Technical Requirements:

-	Outcome of Roulette Wheel Spins = [0,15,27,33,26,14,36,2,16,22,7,17,30,22,28,9,10,11,6,1,33,10,15,18,11,9,1,7,30,30,36,36]
-	A1 consisting of 16 numbers ( which are 4 x Corner Bets) are [2, 3, 5, 6, 17, 18, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35]

-	A2 consisting of 30 numbers (which are 5 x Six-Line Bets) are 1-6, 13-18, 19-24, 25-30 and 31-36 

-   The DataFrame has the columns ['line', 'outcome', 'win', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'actual bet', 'negative', 'positive', 'balance']

## Implementation:

1.	The meaning of the DataFrame Columns are:

-	'line' : The Bet Number
-	'outcome': The Outcome of the Roulette Spin read from the list of Numbers sequentially
-	'win': If it was a Win 'W'  or a Loss 'L' 
-	'a' , 'b' and 'c':  are sequence codes ( see 'sequence codes' section)
-	'actual bet': The Amount ( in chips ) bet
-	'negative' and 'positive': have an integer value of 0 at this stage 
-	'balance': cumulative profit or loss ( in chips )

## Sequence Codes

-   The Sequence Codes are represented by the variables 'a', 'b' & 'c'
-   The Sequence Codes are calculated AFTER the 'outcome' and applied to the next bet.
-   The Initial Sequence Code has the value 3 4 2 ie: 'a' = 3, 'b' = 4 and 'c' = 2
-   Depending on a Win or a Loss the value of the variables are as follows:
    
    1. In the Case of a Win:

        -   if a > 13 then a = 10
        -   if 10 < a < 14 then a = a-4
        -   if 7 < a < 11 then a = a-3
        -   if a < 8 then a = a-2
        -   if a win occurs when a<4 then the sequence is completed
        -   b=b-c
        -   c = (int(b/a))*2

    2. In the Case of a Loss:

        -   a = a+1
        -   b = b+c
        -   c = (int(b/a))*2

    3. If B > 89 then B = (Int(B+1)) / 2

## Mixed Numbers

- When a bet has been made and there has been a loss, this is recorded in the negative and positive columns of the
dataframe as shown in ## example dataframe. A loss is recorded as a Mixed Number for example in Line 28 the loss is 5 chips which is recorded as a Mixed Number of -2.3 with the Integer value -2 representing 2 units of 4 chips which is 8 chips. The decimal part of this mixed number is a number of positive chips, in this case 3 so we have (-8) chips plus 3 which is equal to 5 chips.

- On Line 29 Bet 2 is a 1unit bet ( 4chips) and as it is a loss it just gets add to the existing amount in the negative column ie: -2 + (-1). 

- Line 30 Bet 3 is a 2 unit bet (8 chips) and a loss so the new value in the negative column is now -3 + (-2)

- As Bet 3 has lost this is the end of Stage 1 and in the last 3 bets 17 chips have been lost which is represented by the mixed Number -5.3

- When there is a loss there is no need to record any value in the Balance column at this stage. In Stage 2 we will attempt to recover this 17 chip loss and then the Balance can be updated accordingly.

- Here is an example of some Mixed Numbers and their Base 10 Value ( Chips )

Mixed Number          Base 10 Chips

2.0                      8                       
-2.3                    -5
-6.1                    -23
-5.3                    -17
-15.2                   -58
12.1                    49

## Wins on Mixed Numbers

- When Bet 2 or Bet 3 have been made and there has been a Win ( A1 Number ), this is handled a bit differently than when there's  a loss.

- It's important to understand the concept of Built In Profit ( BIP ) when recording Mixed Numbers in a Win     Situation. Perhaps it's best to illustrate this in the following table:

### Built in Profit Table

Mixed Number    Built In Profit in Chips (Win Only)   Built In Profit as a Mixed Number ( Win Only ) 

1               1                                       .1
2               2                                       .2 
3               3                                       .3
4               4                                       1
5               5                                       1.1
6               6                                       1.2
7               7                                       1.3
8               8                                       2

- ***Example** I have made a change to the ## Example DataFrame where Line 30 Outcome has been changed to (29) which is a Bet3 Win. In this case Bet 3 which is a 2 Unit Bet has resulted in the negative column being reduced to -1 ie: -3 + (-2). In addition to this there is a Built In Profit (BIP) in a 2 Unit Bet when it wins of 2 Chips ( refer the above table ) and this BIP is added on to the amount already in the Positive Column. So in this case the BIP of .2 is added to .3 = 1.1. The Value of the negative and positive column is now added leaving an amount of .1 which represents 1 chip. this is now added to the cumulative balance of 7 bringing the new total to 8.

- The Loss has been recovered when the addition of the positive and negative >= 0
