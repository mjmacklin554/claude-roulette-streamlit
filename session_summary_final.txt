# Claude Roulette Development Session Summary
Date: 2025-10-20
Updated: Complete Streamlit Web Application

## Final Working Implementation: roulette_fresh.py

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. Complete Streamlit Web Application
- **Framework**: Full Streamlit web interface with interactive controls
- **File Input System**: Excel (.xls/.xlsx) and CSV file support from 'numbers' folder
- **User Configuration**:
  - Configurable sequence codes: Standard (3,4,2) or Alternative (8,44,10)
  - Adjustable Stage 2 starting divisor (1-32 range, default: 8)
- **Visual Output**:
  - Interactive DataFrame display
  - Balance progression charts with matplotlib
  - System messages and debug output
  - Comprehensive final summary

#### 2. Complete 2-Stage Betting System
- **Stage 1**: Bet progression with A1 wait rule and four corner loss rule
- **Stage 2**: Unit-based recovery betting with mixed numbers system
- **A1 vs A2 Usage**:
  - A1: Used for Bet2, Bet3, Stage 2 betting, sequence codes, win/loss determination
  - A2: Used ONLY for Bet1
- **Bet Progression**: Bet1(5chips,A2) → Bet2(4chips,A1) → Bet3(8chips,A1) → Stage 2
- **Win/Loss**: 'W' if outcome in A1, 'L' otherwise

#### 3. A1 Wait Rule (Stage 1)
- **Trigger**: After A1 win (outcome in A1 AND bet wins)
- **Wait Logic**: System waits for 3 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Reset Rule**: Any A1 outcome during wait resets counter to 0
- **Resume**: Betting resumes on line AFTER 3rd consecutive non-A1 outcome
- **Stage Scope**: Only active in Stage 1

#### 4. Four Corner Loss Rule
- **Trigger**: After 4 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Effect**: Suppresses sequence code display on next line
- **Stage 1**: Betting continues but codes hidden
- **Stage 2**: Both betting and code display stopped
- **Resume**: After A1 outcome, pending codes applied

#### 5. Sequence Codes
- **Start**: User-configurable (Standard: a=3,b=4,c=2 OR Alternative: a=8,b=44,c=10)
- **Trigger**: Recording starts after first A1 win
- **Win Logic**: Calculate new 'a', b=b-c, c=(int(b/a))*2
- **Loss Logic**: a=a+1, b=b+c, c=(int(b/a))*2
- **Special Rule**: If b > 89 then b = int((b+1)/2)
- **Sequence End**: When a < 3 after first bet placed

#### 6. Mixed Numbers System
- **Purpose**: Track losses and recoveries using base-4 chip system
- **Format**: integer.decimal (integer = units of 4 chips, decimal = individual chips)
- **Stage 1**: Track Bet2/Bet3 losses and wins
- **Stage 2**: Complete recovery system with BIP (Built-in Profit)
- **Recovery**: When negative + positive ≥ 0, profit added to balance

#### 7. Stage 2 Recovery System
- **Trigger**: After Bet3 loss in Stage 1
- **Entry Condition**: a ≤ 10 AND sequence codes displayed
- **Special Rule**: Continue betting when negative > 20 units (bypasses a ≤ 10)
- **Betting**: Units = c ÷ divisor, bet on A1 numbers only
- **Divisor**: User-configurable start, halves when b > 89 during active betting
- **Success**: Complete recovery shows "STOP", adds profit to balance
- **Failure**: Bank lost at 1000 chips (250 units)

#### 8. Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application with pandas and matplotlib
- **File Support**: Excel (.xls/.xlsx) and CSV files from 'numbers' folder
- **Default Outcomes**: [0,15,27,33,26,14,36,2,16,22,7,17,30,22,28,9,10,11,6,1,33,10,15,18,11,9,1,7,30,30,36,36,4,4,32,28,6,10,22,24,33,36,15,34,9,0,0,1,18,19,20,8,17,11,27,16,26,4,29,2,2]
- **A1**: [2,3,5,6,17,18,20,21,25,26,28,29,31,32,34,35] (16 corner bets)
- **A2**: [1-6,13-18,19-24,25-30,31-36] (30 six-line bets)
- **Starting Bank**: 250 units (1000 chips = 250 units)

### Development Evolution

#### Key Breakthroughs Made:
1. **Corrected A1 Wait Rule**: Changed from "3 A1 losses" to "3 consecutive non-A1 outcomes"
2. **Four Corner Loss Rule**: Implemented delayed sequence code display system
3. **Mixed Numbers System**: Complete base-4 loss/recovery tracking
4. **Stage 2 Implementation**: Full unit-based recovery betting with divisor progression
5. **Streamlit Integration**: Complete web application with file input and visualization
6. **Rule Interactions**: Complex timing between A1 wait, four corner rule, and betting stages

#### System Logic Flow

**Stage 1 Example:**
1. **Lines 1-4**: No bets (waiting for first A1 win)
2. **Line 5**: First A1 win → Start sequence codes for next line
3. **Line 6**: Begin betting with codes
4. **A1 Win**: Triggers A1 wait rule (3 consecutive non-A1 wait)
5. **Bet3 Loss**: Triggers Stage 2 with mixed number deficit

**Stage 2 Example:**
1. **Entry**: Wait for a ≤ 10 AND codes displayed
2. **Betting**: Units = c ÷ divisor on A1 numbers
3. **Recovery**: Track mixed numbers until negative + positive ≥ 0
4. **Success**: Display "STOP", add profit to balance, reset for new sequence
