#### 2. Complete 2-Stage Betting System
- **Stage 1**: Bet progression with A1 wait rule and four corner loss rule
- **Stage 2**: Unit-based recovery betting with mixed numbers system
- **A1 vs A2 Usage**:
  - A1: Used for Bet2, Bet3, Stage 2 betting, sequence codes, win/loss determination
  - A2: Used ONLY for Bet1
- **Bet Progression**: Bet1(5chips,A2) → Bet2(4chips,A1) → Bet3(8chips,A1) → Stage 2
- **Win/Loss**: 'W' if outcome in A1, 'L' otherwise
- **Turnover Tracking**: Accumulates total dollar value of all bets placed

#### 3. A1 Wait Rule (Stage 1)
- **Trigger**: After A1 win (outcome in A1 AND bet wins)
- **Wait Logic**: System waits for 3 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Reset Rule**: Any A1 outcome during wait resets counter to 0
- **Resume**: Betting resumes on line AFTER 3rd consecutive non-A1 outcome
- **Stage Scope**: Only active in Stage 1

#### 4. Four Corner Loss Rule
- **Trigger**: After 4 consecutive non-A1 outcomes
- **Effect**: Suppresses sequence code display on next line
- **Stage 1**: Betting continues but codes hidden
- **Stage 2**: Both betting and code display stopped
- **Resume**: After A1 outcome, pending codes applied

#### 5. Sequence Codes
- **Start**: User-configurable (Standard: a=3,b=4,c=2 OR Alternative: a=8,b=44,c=10)
- **Trigger**: Recording starts after first A1 win
- **Win Logic**: Calculate new 'a', b=b-c, c=(int(b/a))*2
- **Loss Logic**: a=a+1, b=b+c, c=(int(b/a))*2
- **Special Rule**: If b > 89 then b = int((b+1)/2)
- **Sequence End**: When a < 3 after first bet placed

#### 6. Mixed Numbers System
- **Purpose**: Track losses and recoveries using base-4 chip system
- **Format**: integer.decimal (integer = units of 4 chips, decimal = individual chips)
- **Stage 1**: Track Bet2/Bet3 losses and wins
- **Stage 2**: Complete recovery system with BIP (Built-in Profit)
- **Recovery**: When negative + positive ≥ 0, profit added to balance

#### 7. Stage 2 Recovery System
- **Trigger**: After Bet3 loss in Stage 1
- **Entry Condition**:
  - If bypass_a10_rule enabled: a ≤ 10 OR negative > 20 units
  - If bypass_a10_rule disabled: a ≤ 10 only (strict enforcement)
  - AND sequence codes must be displayed
- **Bypass Rule**: Configurable option to bypass a ≤ 10 when negative exceeds 20 units
- **Betting**: Base units = c ÷ divisor, bet on A1 numbers only
- **Divisor Options**: User-configurable (8, 16, or 32)
- **Divisor Progression**: Halves when b > 89 during active betting
- **Divisor Reset**: Resets to initial value when sequence completes
- **Sequence Ending Recovery (a ≤ 4)**:
  - Calculates actual chip deficit: -(negative_chips + positive_chips)
  - Minimum recovery units = ceiling(deficit ÷ 5)
  - Bets exactly min_recovery_units (conservative approach)
  - Guarantees negative + positive ≥ 0 if win occurs when sequence is ending
- **Success**: Complete recovery at any 'a' value, sequence resets immediately
- **Success Tracking**: session_successful flag = True if not stuck in Stage 2
- **Failure**: Bank lost at 1000 chips (250 units)

#### 8. Session History System
- **Storage**: JSON files in session_history/ folder
- **Format**: session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
- **Contents**:
  - Configuration (file, sequence codes, divisor, bypass rule)

  - Session success flag (clean finish vs stuck in Stage 2)
  - Final stage indicator (1, 2, or 3)
  - Complete DataFrame with all betting details
  - Balance progression history
  - Debug messages

- **Display**:
  - Per-session turnover in session list
  - Total turnover across all sessions in statistics
  - Turnover included in session details
- **Saved**: Stored with each session in history

#### 11. Success/Failure Tracking
- **Session Success Definition**:
  - ✓ Success: Session ended cleanly (Stage 1 or recovered from Stage 2)
  - ✗ Not Successful: Session ended stuck in unfinished Stage 2
- **Determination**: session_successful = (stage != 2) when outcomes run out
- **Display**:
  - Success column in session list (✓/✗)
  - Final Stage shown in session details
  - Success status in session summary
- **Purpose**: Identify sessions that completed all recoveries vs those stuck mid-recovery

#### 12. Worst Drawdown Tracking

#### System Logic Flow

**Stage 1 Example:**
1. **Lines 1-4**: No bets (waiting for first A1 win)
2. **Line 5**: First A1 win → Start sequence codes for next line
3. **Line 6**: Begin betting with codes
4. **A1 Win**: Triggers A1 wait rule (3 consecutive non-A1 wait)
5. **Bet3 Loss**: Triggers Stage 2 with mixed number deficit

**Stage 2 Example:**
1. **Entry**: Wait for appropriate conditions:
   - If bypass enabled: a ≤ 10 OR negative > 20
   - If bypass disabled: a ≤ 10 only
   - AND codes must be displayed
2. **Betting**: Base units = c ÷ divisor on A1 numbers
3. **Sequence Ending (a ≤ 4)**: Bet exactly minimum units needed for full recovery
4. **Divisor Management**: Halves when b > 89, resets when sequence completes
5. **Recovery**: Track mixed numbers until negative + positive ≥ 0
6. **Success**: Recovery can occur at any 'a' value, sequence resets immediately
7. **Reset**: Display "STOP" once, then start new sequence with fresh codes and divisor
8. **Session Success**: If outcomes run out while in Stage 2, marked as unsuccessful

**Live Play Example:**
1. **Start Session**: Configure settings and click Start
2. **Wait for A1**: Enter numbers until first A1 win
3. **Recording Active**: System shows betting recommendations
4. **Continue**: Enter each number as it comes up
5. **Save**: Save numbers to .txt file
6. **Analyze**: Load saved file in Run Simulation for complete analysis

**Session History Example:**
1. **View Statistics**: Overall performance across all sessions
2. **Browse Sessions**: Scrollable table with all session data
3. **Select Sessions**: Use checkboxes to mark sessions for deletion
4. **Delete**: Delete selected sessions or all sessions
5. **View Details**: Examine individual session with charts and data
6. **Compare**: Compare multiple sessions side-by-side

### Interactive Spinning Wheel Development (v1.0.0)

#### Wheel Implementation
**Component**: `roulette_wheel_interactive.html` (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript)

**Features Achieved:**
1. **Accurate European Layout**: 37 pockets (0-36) in standard European order
2. **Visual Design**:
   - Individual pocket boxes positioned radially around wheel
   - Pocket dimensions: 28px width × 40px height (prevents overlap)
   - Color-coded: Green (0), Red (18 numbers), Black (18 numbers)
   - Uniform gold border (15px) around wheel using flexbox centering
   - Casino-style gradient effects and shadows

3. **Spinning Animation**:
   - Duration: 4 seconds
   - Easing: cubic-bezier(0.17, 0.67, 0.12, 0.99)
   - Rotations: 5-8 full spins (integer only)
   - Gold pointer at top (12 o'clock position)

4. **Landing Accuracy**:
   - Problem: Initially wheel landed on wrong numbers (RNG vs visual mismatch)
   - Root causes identified:
     - Fractional spin degrees (non-integer spins)
     - Rotation direction confusion
     - Complex accumulated rotation tracking
   - Final solution: `rotation = 360 × n - pocket_angle`
   - Result: 100% visual accuracy - wheel lands on correct number every time

5. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Winning pocket highlighted with gold border
   - Pulse animation on winning pocket
   - Result displayed prominently with color
   - Message prompts user to enter number

#### Integration with Streamlit
- Embedded via `components.html()` with 800px height
- Dual input mode: Manual Entry OR Spinning Wheel
- User workflow:
  1. Click "SPIN WHEEL"
  2. Watch animation
  3. See result displayed
  4. Enter number in field below
  5. Click "Process Wheel Result"
  6. Betting system processes outcome

#### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **Pocket Visibility**: Changed from triangular segments to positioned boxes
2. **Overlap Prevention**: Precise sizing calculations for 37 pockets
3. **Rotation Math**: Corrected formula from complex to simple approach
4. **Border Uniformity**: Switched from padding to flexbox + calc()
5. **Component Communication**: One-way message passing (wheel → streamlit)
